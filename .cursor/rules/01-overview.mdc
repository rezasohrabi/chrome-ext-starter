## Project Overview

This repository is a Chrome Extension starter using Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and the CRX plugin. It provides a production-ready structure for MV3 extensions with content scripts rendered in Shadow DOM, themed UI, and strict TypeScript/ESLint/Prettier settings.

### Goals for AI-generated code

- Follow the existing architecture and naming conventions
- Prefer functional React components with strict TypeScript types
- Use Tailwind + DaisyUI classes for all styling
- Keep content scripts isolated via Shadow DOM and `:host` styling
- Respect dev/prod behaviors in `src/manifest.ts`
