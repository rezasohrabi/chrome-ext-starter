## Scripts

- `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm preview`.
- Use pnpm only (enforced by preinstall).

## Commit & CI

- Conventional commits (commitlint).
- Pre-commit: lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier).

## DOs

- Use functional React + strict TS types.
- Use Tailwind/DaisyUI classes for styling.
- Keep content scripts in Shadow DOM.
- Include `data-theme` on root containers.
- Use aliases for imports.

## DON'Ts

- No class components; no inline styles.
- Do not mutate DOM outside Shadow DOM in content scripts.
- Avoid absolute px in custom CSS; prefer utilities.
