# Snoozr Feature Generation

Your goal is to create a new feature for the Snoozr Chrome Extension.

## Requirements

Please provide the following information if not already specified:

- Feature name
- Feature description
- Where the feature should be accessible (popup, options page, context menu, etc.)

## Architectural Guidelines

When implementing this feature:

1. **UI Components**:

   - Use functional React components with hooks
   - Follow DaisyUI patterns for consistent styling
   - Support dark mode through our theme implementation
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling

2. **Data Management**:

   - For persistent data, use Chrome's storage API:
     - Use `chrome.storage.sync` for user preferences and small data sets
     - Use `chrome.storage.local` for larger data sets or device-specific information
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Implement proper error handling for storage operations

3. **Extension Communication**:

   - Use message passing for communication between different extension contexts
   - Follow the async/await pattern for all asynchronous operations
   - Define message types in the shared types directory

4. **Chrome API Usage**:
   - Follow Chrome Extension Manifest V3 best practices
   - Request only necessary permissions
   - Handle API errors gracefully
   - Provide fallbacks where appropriate

## Implementation Outline

The implementation should include:

1. UI components for user interaction
2. Service functions in the appropriate context (background, content, etc.)
3. Data structures and storage handling
4. Integration with existing extension functionality
